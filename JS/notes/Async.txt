Asynchronous Javascript(AJAX):
   Normally , Javascript is synchronous and single threaded language. But sometimes, js can perform asynchronous operations such as API's, timers etc..,
   Asynchronous operations/functions takes time and returns a promise.
   AJAX makes a particular function load without reloading whole page
   document object also supports AJAX
Eg: 1. update of cart in ecommerce without reloading page
    2. getting live twitter updates without reloading
    3. getting updated trending videos from backend in youtube

Timers:
   Timers are webapi's provided by browser similarly document and console
There are two timers available such as
  i. setTimeout:
  it is used to delay certain function
  setTimeout(fn,time in ms)
  ii.setInterval:
  it is used to provide/run a function with certain intervals again and again
  setInterval(fn,time in ms)

  sometimes, we need to stop these timers using folllowing functions such as

  1. clearTimeout
  2.clearInterval
